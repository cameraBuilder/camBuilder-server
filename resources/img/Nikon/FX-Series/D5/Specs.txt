Collapse Exposure
Exposure Metering SystemTTL exposure metering using approximately 180K (180,000) pixels RGB sensor
Metering MethodCenter-weighted: Weight of 75% given to 12 mm circle in center of frame. Diameter of circle can be changed to 8, 15, or 20 mm, or weighting can be based on average of entire frame (non-CPU lenses use 12-mm circle)
Matrix: 3D Color Matrix Metering III (type G, E, and D lenses); Color Matrix Metering III (other CPU lenses); Color Matrix Metering available with non-CPU lenses if user provides lens data
Spot: Meters 4 mm circle (about 1.5% of frame) centered on selected focus point
Highlight-weighted: Available with type G, E, and D lenses; equivalent to center-weighted when non-CPU lens is used
Metering Range-3 ± 20 EV (Matrix or center-weighted metering)
