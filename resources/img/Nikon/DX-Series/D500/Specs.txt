Collapse Exposure
Exposure Metering SystemTTL exposure metering using approximately 180K (180,000) pixels RGB sensor
Metering MethodCenter-weighted: Weight of 75% given to 8 mm circle in center of frame. Diameter of circle can be changed to 6, 10, or 13 mm, or weighting can be based on average of entire frame (non-CPU lenses use 8-mm circle)
Matrix: 3D Color Matrix Metering III (type G, E, and D lenses); Color Matrix Metering III (other CPU lenses); Color Matrix Metering available with non-CPU lenses if user provides lens data
Spot: Meters 3.5 mm circle (about 2.5% of frame) centered on selected focus point
Highlight-weighted: Available with type G, E, and D lenses; equivalent to center-weighted when non-CPU lens is used
Metering Range-3 ± 20 EV (Matrix or center-weighted metering)
