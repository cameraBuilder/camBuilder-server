Compatible LensesAF NIKKOR lenses, including type G, E, and D lenses (some restrictions apply AF NIKKOR lenses, including type G and D lenses (some restrictions apply to PC lenses) and DX lenses (using DX 24 x 16 1.5x image area), AI-P NIKKOR lenses, and non-CPU AI lenses (A and M modes only). to PC lenses) and DX lenses (using DX 24 x 16 1.5x image area), AI-P NIKKOR lenses, and non-CPU AI lenses (A and M modes only).
Electronic rangefinder can be used with lenses that have a maximum aperture of f/5.6 or faster (the electronic rangefinder supports the 11 focus points with lenses that have a maximum aperture of f/8 or faster).
IX NIKKOR lenses, lenses for the F3AF, and non-AI lenses cannot be used.

Collapse Exposure
Exposure Metering SystemTTL exposure metering using 91,000-pixel RGB sensor
Metering MethodCenter-weighted: Weight of 75% given to 12 mm circle in center of frame. Diameter of circle can be changed to 8, 15, or 20 mm, or weighting can be based on average of entire frame (non-CPU lenses use 12-mm circle)
Matrix: 3D Color Matrix Metering II (type G, E, and D lenses); Color Matrix Metering II (other CPU lenses); Color Matrix Metering available with non-CPU lenses if user provides lens data
Spot: Meters 4 mm circle (about 1.5% of frame) centered on selected focus point (on center focus point when non-CPU lens is used)
Highlight-weighted: Available with type G, E, and D lenses; equivalent to center-weighted when non-CPU lens is used
Metering Range0 to 20 EV (3D Color Matrix, center-weighted metering or highlight weighted metering)
